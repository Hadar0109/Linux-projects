Compilation:
To compile all required components, run the following command:
    make all

This will generate all executable files and the shared library automatically.

File Naming:
The names of the source files corresponding to each section of the assignment are as follows:
1: printdb.cpp
2: block_finder.cpp
3: db_to_csv.cpp
4: reload_db.cpp
5: bitcoin_shell.cpp

Important Note:
If you choose to execute the main programs of Sections 1–3 (i.e., `block_finder.out`, `db_to_csv.out`, `printdb.out`) without first running Section 5 or Section 4, the necessary blocks will not be loaded into memory.
Therefore, these components should be executed after block loading has taken place.
